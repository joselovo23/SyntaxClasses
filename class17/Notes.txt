Types of variables:
There are 3 types of variables: local, instance, and static

If the variable is inside a method, it is a local variable

If we are creating a variable outside of a method, but inside a class, it is called
an instance varible

If that instance variable has a static keyword, it is called a static variable

Class Vars{
int age=10; //this variable is inside a class, outside a method; instance variable
static double weight=25.5; //static variable
void method(){
String name="Moreed"; //this variable is inside a method; local variable
}



}

local variables:
If a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block
of code, it is called a local variable

Instance  variables:
If a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then
it is called an instance variable

Static variable:

If a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class
and it has static keyword, then it is called a static variable

When to use which type of variable:
Local variables:
Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables
because they occupy the computers memory for short amount of time
As soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them
Pros: save memory
Cons: not accessible outside of method/block of code

Instance Variable:
When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is
expected to be different from object to object we should go with instance variables
Pros: Accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons: Occupy the computers memory longer than local variables

Static variables:
When we know that the information will stay the same for all the objects
of a class, we should create a static variable for that
Pros: Single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons: Stays longer in the memory; can hold only one value at a time
