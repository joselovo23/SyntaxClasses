Types of variables:
There are three types of variables: Local, Instance, and static

Local Variables
The variables that are declared inside a method or block of code are called local
variables
Pros: Save memory
Cons: Limited access can not be accessed outside of methods or block of code where
they are declared.

Instance Variables:
The variables which are declared inside a class but outside a method
or block of code are called instance variables.
Pros: Instance variables are accessible in all the methods of that class
Cons: They occupy the computers memory for longer as compared to local variables

Static Variables:
If instance variables have the static keyword with them, they are called static variables
Pros: Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons: Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside
the memory than instance variables
===================================================================
Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in Java that defines from where a certain variable,
method or a class can be accessed
There are 4 types of access in Java that we can define using three keywords:
1) Private 2) Protected 3) Public
4 Types of access
1) Private 2) Default(applied when no keyword is used 3) Protected 4) Public

private access(keyword is private):
When we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes,
these can only be accessed within that class

default access(applied when we don't use any keyword):
When we don't use any of the keywords, default access is applied by Java to those
variables, methods, or classes. Which means these things can only be accessed
from the same package.

protected access(we use the protected class):
When protected access is applied, class members(variables methods etc.) can
be accessed from other packages but only in the classes that participate in
inheritance

public access(public keyword):
Public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside
that project.
