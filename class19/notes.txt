Access Modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members (fields, methods,
 constructors,etc. ) and classes itself in Java
 There a 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we used to define these access
 levels. Fourth level is applied when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
 Levels from most restricted to less restricted are:
 1)private(keyword is also private)
 2)default(no keyword means default access level)
 3)protected(keyword is also protected)
 4)public(keyword is also public)
 Rules:
 1)We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data
 and the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks if we don't perform
 sanity checks before setting the values to these fields. Our classes and methods might
 misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not every one can access
 the data.
2)We can't use access modifiers with local variables

Constructors:
Constructors in Java allow us to set the values of the fields of a
class.
