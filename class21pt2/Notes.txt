Inheritance in Java:
Its a mechanism in Java through which a child class gets the properties and methods
from a parent class.
Benefits:
    1) Saves time to code
    2) Code duplication is reduced
    3) execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
    1) Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class,
    it is also changed in the child class.
Types of inheritance:
    There are four types of inheritance but Java only supports 3 of them
    1) Single
    2) Hierarchical
    3) Multilevel
    4) Multiple(not supported in Java)
Single Inheritance:
    In single inheritance, we have only one child and one parent class. Or only two
    classes participate in inheritance, one as child, one as parent.

    ex:
class Parent{


}
class Child extends Parent{
Hierarchical:
    In Hierarchical inheritance, we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes
    ex:
class Parent{

}
class Child1 extends Parent{

}
class Child2 extends Parent{

}
Multilevel:
    We have multiple levels of inheritance for example, if we have classes A, B, & C,
    class C will be inherited from B, and B will be inherited from A.

    Class A{

    }
    Class B extends A{

    }
    Class C extends B{

    }

Super Keyword:
Super Keyword is like the "this", it refers to the parent class object.
For example: we can access the fields method or constructors of parent class inside the child
class using this keyword.
