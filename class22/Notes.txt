Super Keyword:
Super is keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object. We can
use the super keyword in 3 different ways
1) To access the super class variables, if we have the same name
variables in super class and base class.
2) If we have the same method names in parent and child class, we can use the super keyword
to access teh parent class method, otherwise by default, Java refers to the same child class
methods.
3) As constructors don't participate in inheritance, we can use super() to call the
constructors from teh parent class.
Rules:
1) If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arguments, we must have a constructor
inside the child class that at least takes those two arguments
2) We can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor
3)super can't be used in static methods
==================================================================
Method overloading in Java:
If we have same name methods in a class with different number of parameters
or different sequence of parameters or different data types of the parameters it is called method
overloading.
class calculator{

void add(int number, int number2){
}
void add(int number, double number2){
}
void add(double number2, int number2){
}
void add(double number, double number2){
}
void add(int number, int number2, in number3){
}

}
