1) private (keyword is also private) - access only the file in which it is created
2) default (no keyword means default) - everyone can see it; default gives access to everything in the same package
3) protected (keyword is also protected) - gives access within the package and if it's access through a subclass by doing "extends" the original
4) public (keyword is also public) -everyone can see it; public gives access even outside the package




Method overloading in Java:
    When same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters
    or different data type of parameters or different sequence of parameters.
Advantages of method overloading:
    Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
    End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method name
Rules:
    We overload the constructors
    We can overload the static methods as well
    We can overload the main method as well
Rules fo static methods:
Static methods can't access instance fields directly

Method overriding:
    1) Method overriding happens when we have the same name methods in the parent class
    and in the child class
    2) we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two
    classes
    3) We can't override the private methods because they don't participate in
    inheritance
    4) We can't override the constructors because they don't participate in inheritance
