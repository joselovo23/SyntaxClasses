Method overriding in Java
    Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in parent and child class classes.
Benefits
    1) Flexibility if we don't like something from the parent class we can ovverride it
    and can provide our own implementaion.
    2) Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.
Rules:
    1)Without inheritance method overriding is not possible
    2) method signature should be same in parent class and in child class
    3) If something does not participate in inheritance, we can't override it like constructors
    and private methods
    4) We can increase the visibility in the child class, but we can't decrease it
    for example we can go from default or protected to public, but we can't do the reverse
    5) We can't override a static method but we can redeclare it. for example, main method can't be overridden as it is static.
    6) We can't have different return type in teh child class it must be same as child class.

OOPS Main Pillars
1) Inheritance(code re-usability)
2) Polymorphism(less code, dynamic code)
3) Abstraction()
4) Encapsulating
